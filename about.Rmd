Here is more about me, the blogger and first year PhD student, and more about what I plan on adding to my website for resources. 

First, hello, I'm a first year grad student at UNH and am a Genetics PhD student. I;m originally from Arundel, ME (born and raised) but plan on moving as I do so frequently. I love anything to do with working out such as yoga, going to the gym, rock climbing, and kayaking. I also love drawing/painting and the arts. Spending quality time with close friends and family is always a must for me as well. 

As for the website - I will be posting different links to tips/tricks on getting through grad school, how to pick a research topic, how to keep your mental health a priority with mental health resources, fellowship opportunities and advice, and most importantly my research and all it's updates!
