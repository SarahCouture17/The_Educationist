Below are my personalized tips for staying happy and healthy during grad school.

Be outdoors! Go outside. Just. Go. Outside. Go for a 5 minute walk even. Just be outside as much as you can.
Eat as healthy as you can during the week so you can enjoy your weekends eating and drinking whatever you want. Trust me, this works!
Do. Not. Procrastinate. I know it may seem like you have a whole week to get it done but trust me when I say 5 days go by fast. Just lean on time management and get it done!
Lean on your freinds and family. You will not survive grad school alone. Call that old friend, call your mom or dad, call your significant other. Better yet, go see them! Quality time trumpts beling alone.
Take breaks. I know studying may always seem like a crash course but just please take 5 mins and go pee?! Maybe have a granola bar?! Oh, and unclench that jaw.
Be proactive. Stay on top of things. Buy and actually use a planner. Keep track of your mental health. Sleep well. Eat 3 meals a day please.
Make yourself a reward system. Nothing is better than looking forward to something. Everytime you do something big for yourself educationally, have a treat in mind you get to get yourself as a reward.
Know your advisor and become their BFF. I am serious. Get to know them, see them frequently, talk to them often. There is going to be no one who helps you like they do.
Sleep, sleep, sleep. Please get some sleep, okay? My goodness does no one sleep in college. Especially grad school! Even just a 15 minute power nap could change your day.
Keep an eye on your mental health. School does not even trump this. Do not push yourself so hard that you crash. Graduate school may be importnant, but nothing is more importnant that your life. See someone if needed. Reach out if needed.
